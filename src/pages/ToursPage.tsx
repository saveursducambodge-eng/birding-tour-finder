Originally built as a Hindu temple with later Buddhist carvings, it remains largely unrestored, with trees and dense vegetation growing among its towers and courtyards.

    food: "Khmer cuisine similar to most Southeast Asian cooking but rather less spicy. Traditional cuisine recovering after knowledge lost through years of war. Lodge staff cook wide variety of good local food. Former French influence means good bread readily available in many areas. For beer lovers, surprisingly wide range of local brews to try. Bunong traditional meals at Jahoo Gibbon Camp.",

The best time to visit for a wide range of species, particularly waterbirds, is typically from January to April.",
